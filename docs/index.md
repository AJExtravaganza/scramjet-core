## scramjet : Object
Scramjet main exports expose all the stream classes and a number of methods.

All scramjet streams allow writing, reading or transform modes - currently
exclusively (meaning you can't have two at once). Any of the scramjet streams
can be constructed with the following options passed to mimic node.js standard streams:

* `async promiseTransform(chunk)` - transform method that resolves with a single output chunk
* `async promiseWrite(chunk)` - write method that that resolves when chunk is written
* `async promiseWriteV(chunk)` - write method that that resolves when chunk is written
* `async promiseRead(count)` - read method that resolves with an array of chunks when called

See [node.js API for stream implementers for details](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_implementers)
